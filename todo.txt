PRIORITY:
- Change mutation function so that each bit has a probability to be flipped of 5%
- Change the consecutive scheduling to a more efficient algorithm, if classes are given on the same timeslot they don't have to be equal, 
just check conflicts! If classes are the same you can check on class group and class type, otherwise just check conflicts


EXTRA:
- With the consecutive scheduled courses, make sure they are not scheduled before and right after the lunch or diner break
- AP classes should be seperated.
- Make sure the classes are not spread too much. For example if a class is given from 8am until 10pm and another class is scheduled 
that day, it would be better to schedule it from 10am until 12am rather than scheduling that last course at night from 7pm until 9pm.
- A teacher can teach multiple courses but make sure the teacher doesnt have to teach too much in a day.
