PRIORITY:
- Keep in mind that teacher can only be scheduled to teach a class on a given timeslot when they are available to teach that class.
- The number of classes in a week should correspond with the AT and AP number. --> dynamic programming regarding the class_types!!
- A qualified teacher has to be assigned for a specific course
- Only 1 turma starting from etapa 4

EXTRA:
- AP classes should be seperated.
- Make sure the classes are not spread too much. For example if a class is given from 8am until 10pm and another class is scheduled 
that day, it would be better to schedule it from 10am until 12am rather than scheduling that last course at night from 7pm until 9pm.
- A teacher can teach multiple courses but make sure the teacher doesnt have to teach too much in a day.
