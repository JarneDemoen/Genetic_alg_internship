PRIORITY:
- Implement other constraints once the algorithm seems to be working fast enough
- AP classes should be seperated, AT together if there are multiple turma's
- Professor availability

EXTRA:
- With the consecutive scheduled courses, make sure they are not scheduled before and right after the lunch or diner break
- Make sure the classes are not spread too much. For example if a class is given from 8am until 10pm and another class is scheduled 
that day, it would be better to schedule it from 10am until 12am rather than scheduling that last course at night from 7pm until 9pm.
- A teacher can teach multiple courses but make sure the teacher doesnt have to teach too much in a day.

I will first give you some information and then you solve the problem when I say so.
The information is the following:
Paste genome
paste timeslot day
paste timeslots
paste input_professor_availability
paste professor competence
I have a genome that consists of a list of dictionaries. each dictionary contains the following information:
{'class': 'HF222', 'class_type': 'AT', 'class_group': 'A', 'professor': 13.034, 'timeslot_day': 'Monday', 'timeslot': '12:45-13:35', 'et': 1},
with class is the class name and et is etapa which means semester. Now I have to assign a correct timeslot_day, professor and timeslot to each class.
There are some constraints that I have to take into account: Virtual classes have class_type AV and should be scheduled on the timeslots with index 0,1,2 or 3.
These virtual classes have to be scheduled on 2 consecutive timeslots and they have to have the same professor.The professor has to be available on the timeslots too.
