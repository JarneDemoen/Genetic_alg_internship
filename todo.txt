PRIORITY:
- Implement other constraints once the algorithm seems to be working fast enough
- AP classes should be seperated, AT together if there are multiple turma's
- Check for conflicts with other courses (if a student has 2 courses at the same time) or if a teacher has to teach a subject at the same time
- Professor availability

EXTRA:
- With the consecutive scheduled courses, make sure they are not scheduled before and right after the lunch or diner break
- Make sure the classes are not spread too much. For example if a class is given from 8am until 10pm and another class is scheduled 
that day, it would be better to schedule it from 10am until 12am rather than scheduling that last course at night from 7pm until 9pm.
- A teacher can teach multiple courses but make sure the teacher doesnt have to teach too much in a day.
