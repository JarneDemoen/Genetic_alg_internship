- Implementation of the professor availability
- Add a constraint where only virtual classes can be scheduled on the first timeslot
- Deleted the consecutive classes rule as it slowed down the algorithm and it was not that important
- Created conventional algorithm to assign professors to each class
- Let the algorithm run a couple of times and show the best one
