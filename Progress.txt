- Made it faster by reducing the population amount to 20 instead of 100 and by not calculating the hex_genome
- Number of scheduled classes is now correct 
- Created the no duplicates csv, because I create the variations in the code
- OOP implementation with numpy (not particularly faster)
- Guided mutation with population of 10 gave promising results --> perfect solution for professor and saturday constraint in 304 seconds (480 generations)
- With the selection operator --> select only out of the 5 best solutions --> perfect solution for professor and saturday constraint in 209 seconds (357 generations)
- Changed the timeslots so everything is always scheduled for 2 hours straight
